### üßê How Important Is This?

- Critical - we can't do anything if this isn't actioned immediately (product doesn't function without this, it's blocking us or users, or it resolves a high severity security issue)
- Important - we have to do this before we ship, but it can wait until the next sprint (product won't function without it, but it's not blocking us or users right now)
- Should have - it would be better if we do this before we ship, but it's OK if we don't (product functions without this, but it's a better user experience)
- Nice to have - it really doesn't matter if we do this (product functions without this, impact to user is minimal)
